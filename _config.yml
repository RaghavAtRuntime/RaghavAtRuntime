          During my time at UofT I have learned many key skills that have benefitted me at my internships such as teamwork, working tight deadlines and personal motivation. As I progress through my courses, I'm learning a lot about quality of work, leadership and a healthy work-life balance.

          I've spent a lot of time participating in hackathons and clubs like the UofT stock trading club and the UofT Machine Intelligence Student Team which have helped me gain valuable technical skills in both finance and machine learning.
